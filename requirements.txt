Hey sorry for this crappy PR but there is no issues tab, and not sure where to ask this question (maybe add that in the readme - my 2 cents).
I am looking for info on how to use this VPN client to route network traffic through the VPN *only* for certain IPs. Basically we have one bastion host at one IP and I only want traffic going there to be routed through VPN if that makes sense. How to achieve/accomplish this? ty for your understanding.
